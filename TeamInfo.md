## Project Summary
RecipEZ is a website for students to find suitable recipes they can make with the ingredients they already have in their refrigerators. It provides an easy way to find a list of recipes filtered for ones that only contain what they have on hand. Furthermore, the recipes can be filtered by characteristics such as caloric intake or dietary restriction. Once they have a list of potential recipes, users can choose the perfect one with information such as a description of the recipe, user ratings, etc. After finding and making a new recipe, they can also leave a rating or see the previous recipes they've viewed. This website encourages new cooks to practice their culinary skills while reducing food waste by using up the ingredients they own.
